Our Lean Coffees are held on the fourth Thursday of each month at 11am to midday.

### How 'Lean Coffee' works

Lean Coffee is a structured but agenda-less meeting. See [the Lean Coffee website](http://leancoffee.org/) for more information.

As a community, we populate a [HackMd](https://hackmd.io/) Kanban board with ideas. We then vote for ideas, start discussing in a timeboxed session, and vote whether to continue discussing or move on to the next idea at the end of the timebox.

You do not need to bring any content in advance. We will ask people to contribute topics in the session, however if you have something you want to discuss with the group, you can add it to our HackMd beforehand.

### Getting in touch

Please contact the group facilitators if you need assistance adding topics or want to learn more:

Or reach out in the `#software-development` channel on [UK Government Digital Slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/).

We would really like to see as many government software engineers (including architects, heads of engineering, software testers) at these sessions as possible. Anyone who writes code for public services in UK government and associated bodies or organisations is very welcome.
