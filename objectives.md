# Community Objectives

## Overview

These objectives define how the community will grow, engage members, communicate effectively, and improve diversity and inclusion across government software engineering teams.  

They align with cross-government priorities including learning & development, standards adoption, and representation in DDaT conversations.

---

## 1. Grow the Community

### Objective
Grow a strong, representative cross-government software engineering community.

### Key Outcomes
- Increase total community membership to **1,000 members by October 2026**
- Increase **departmental representation** from **X% to X + 12%**
- Broaden eligibility so membership reflects the **wider software engineering ecosystem**, not only self-identified software developers

### Key Actions
- Review and update the **Terms of Reference (ToR)** to clarify eligibility
- Align Mailchimp, Slack, and event participation criteria with the updated ToR
- Work with Heads of Engineering and Digital Leaders to promote community membership

## 2. Engagement

### Objective
Increase both active and passive engagement across the community.

### 2.1 Active Engagement

Increase the number of members who actively participate in at least one community activity per year.

**Examples**
- Lean Coffee sessions  
- Facilitated events  
- Conferences and meetups  
- Special Interest Groups (SIGs)  
- Working groups  

### 2.2 Passive Engagement

Increase the number of members who are aware of and follow community activity.

**Channels**
- Newsletter readership  
- Social media engagement  
- X-Gov Slack participation  
- Event recordings and write-ups

## 3. Comms & Social Media

### Objective
Ensure consistent, multi-channel communication so community activity is visible and accessible.

### Channels
- **LinkedIn** – professional reach and cross-government visibility  
- **Bluesky** – informal engagement and community discussion  
- **Newsletter** – core updates, events, standards, and learning resources  
- **X-Gov Slack** – day-to-day discussion and quick engagement  

### Key Actions
- Establish a simple **content cadence** (monthly or quarterly)
- Use Heads of Engineering networks and existing platforms to amplify messages
- Ensure all major events, learning resources, and standards updates are communicated consistently

### 4. Promoting diversity and inclusion

### Objective
An aim of the group is to understand 
how can we improve diversity and inclusion within our government software engineering community? and promote greater diversity and understand.

Actively improve gender diversity within the software engineering community.

**What are departments already doing?**

An aim of the group is to understand what departments and bodies are doing in this area.

**Sharing recruitment experience**

An aim of the group is to understand and share recruitment experience. 

### Key Outcomes
- Establish a **baseline** for current representation of women in the community
- Track participation and representation over time
- Increase participation of women in community events and leadership roles

### Key Actions
- Run events specifically aimed at **Women in Tech**
- Highlight role models, career journeys, and learning pathways
- Share good practice across departments on inclusive recruitment and progression

## 5. Learning, Standards & DDaT Representation (Cross-Cutting)

These priorities are embedded across all objectives.

### Learning & Development
- Share learning resources and techniques, including:
  - Apprenticeships
  - Pair programming
  - Hack days and code retreats
  - Learning platforms (e.g. Pluralsight, O’Reilly)

### Championing Standards
- Promote cross-government software engineering standards
- Share departmental standards and good practice
- Improve how standards are communicated and adopted within teams

### DDaT Representation
- Represent the software engineering community in DDaT discussions
- Provide feedback on the DDaT Framework
- Surface community insights, gaps, and emerging needs

An aim of the group is to discuss and represent the community in relation to the [DDAT Framework](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/software-developer)

## Review and Iteration

These objectives will be reviewed periodically to:
- Track progress against outcomes
- Refresh ownership where needed
- Respond to changes in cross-government priorities
