<td style="text-align:left" class="govuk-table__cell">When I first joined the civil service over two years ago I felt particularly at sea as a developer in a new agency with limited digital experience. Finding the X-gov community has been a massive support in getting advice about common problems and building a network across government. I’m keen to work with the new management committee to keep the community a vibrant and welcoming place where we run regular events like the January 2025 conference. As part of the organising committee for the 2025 conference I’ve got experience planning events and coordinating volunteers. I’d be grateful for your support to continue building the software community across government and creating more opportunities for us to get together and collaborate to solve our common problems.</td>

<td style="text-align:left" class="govuk-table__cell">As a career changer who has recently entered the industry, I bring a fresh perspective, a deep appreciation for the opportunities it offers, and a strong desire to contribute meaningfully to its growth. I believe this gives me a unique lens to understand both the challenges and the potential of our sector. I am passionate about helping shape the industry into the best version of itself—one that is inclusive, forward-thinking, and representative of the diverse voices within it. I want to actively support others navigating their own professional journeys and ensure that all individuals feel seen, heard, and empowered to thrive. Joining the facilitators committee would allow me to help drive positive change, advocate for inclusivity, and represent a broad range of experiences and perspectives. I’m eager to collaborate, share ideas, and help create an environment that supports continuous learning, growth, and belonging for everyone involved.</td>

<td style="text-align:left" class="govuk-table__cell">Having been a member and facilitator for the community for a number of years (early in 2019, and post reboot ) I would appreciate your support. I am keen to continue to support the group and continue helping the management committee support the developer community. I am especially keen to ensure we champion the community in the open and attract new and diverse talent to help drive responsible development grounded in good practices and principles showing that UK public services can operate very well at scale. I have experience running communities, events and hackathons inside and outside of government. I am willing to help with all tasks required of organising events, workshops and facilitating discussions. I am excited to see how the community can flourish building on our collective successes so far, from virtual events to conferences.</td>

<td style="text-align:left" class="govuk-table__cell">With over 14 years of experience, I’ve worked as a professional software developer across sectors including banking, digital banking, fintech, and government. My career has included roles in a multinational consulting firm, one of the Big Four (EY), and a Silicon Valley-based SaaS company building grant management solutions. I currently serve as a Technical Lead and Senior Systems Developer at the UK Health Security Agency. While at EY, I led a project automating manual processes using Robotic Process Automation (RPA). This broad background has given me insight into both the high-paced demands of industry and the complexity of delivering impactful, user-centred digital services in government. As a volunteer, I’m currently leading an initiative exploring the use of AI tools — including OpenAI and Gemini — to help break down language barriers in multilingual community settings. I was part of the organising committee for the first Cross UK Government Software Engineering Conference in 2025 and saw the energy and potential that cross-department collaboration can unlock. I believe this community can harness that momentum year-round through events, mentoring, and open sharing of knowledge and tools. If selected, I will support inclusive engagement, promote visibility of good engineering practices across government, and help foster a culture of openness and continuous learning. I’m particularly passionate about supporting emerging developers and inspiring the next generation. I also hope to use this platform to explore how AI can safely and responsibly enhance software development, delivering greater value to government and public services.</td>

Formerly Head of Role for Software Engineering &amp; DevOps at UK Home office</td>
<td style="text-align:left" class="govuk-table__cell">I’ve been a software developer for over 15 years, working at all levels across a bunch of UK government departments as a civil servant who has now turned consultant. That’s given me a solid sense of the challenges and quirks of public sector engineering, and shown me just how valuable it is when departments actually collaborate and share what they’ve learned. Over the years, I’ve spent a lot of time building and supporting engineering communities. I’ve run community events, public hackathons, led on recruitment, diversity and outreach, and tried to create spaces where people can connect, swap ideas, and learn from each other. I think that kind of community is vital, especially in government where teams often end up solving the same problems in isolation - even within a single department, let alone cross-government. I care a lot about making engineering a bit less siloed and a lot more open, collaborative and welcoming. I see the management committee as a great way to keep that kind of culture going, and I’d love to be part of shaping it.</td>

I helped to found the Cross Government Software Engineering Community in 2019 and along with Andy Poole revived it again after a lull during COVID. I’m passionate about engineering as a public service and keen to see the cross government community continue to thrive.  If elected to the committee, I’ll continue to work to grow our impact as a network for practitioners.</td>
