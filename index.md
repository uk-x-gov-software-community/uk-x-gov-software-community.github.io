# Welcome to the Cross Government Software Community 

## Who are we
We are a group of engineers working in software engineering across government, some of us are hands on developers, others working in other technical or management roles.
## Vision
To provide a forum for collaboration for software engineers across government
*	To learn and to teach
*	To share ideas
*	To have some fun

## How are we doing this
*	Running monthly virtual lean coffee sessions 
*	Developing our GitHub repo
*	Looking to run more themed events 
*	Hosting a virtual software engineering meetup in 2022
*	We have a small facilitation group that is doing some of the initial setup
