# Cross Government Software Engineering Community - Terms of Reference (DRAFT)

## Purpose and authority

The Cross Government Software Engineering Community is a voluntary association of Software Engineers/Developers working in the UK Civil Service. 

We exist to foster collaboration, knowledge sharing, and professional development among software engineers and related roles across the UK Government. We do this by running online and in-person events such as lean coffee meetings, special interest groups and conferences.

We aim to be recognised as a source of expertise on Software Engineering/Development practice, on the Software Engineering profession and to act as a key stakeholder to the Government Digital and Data Function. 

We do not set or define government policy or standards.

## Objectives

Our objectives, as of May 2025 are:

1. **Connect development teams across government** - by running community networking and knowledge sharing events  
2. **Learning and development** - facilitate sharing of techniques, materials and approaches that support learning and development for developers and software engineers  
3. **Championing standards** - facilitate the sharing of software engineering standards and good practice   
4. **Promoting diversity and inclusion** - through advocacy and connecting work between departments to share good practice  
5. **Represent the software engineering community in Government Digital and Data profession forums** 

Our objectives will be revised at least annually at the discretion of the management committee and [published on our website](https://uk-x-gov-software-community.github.io/objectives/).

## Membership

The scope of our membership and activities is aligned with the [Government Digital and Data Function](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-functions/government-functions). As such our primary focus is on [Central Government departments and arms length bodies](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations), but we are open to participation from the wider public sector. We invite anyone aligned with the "[Software Developer](https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/software-developer)" role in the GDaD framework to participate in our community. 

To be a **member** of the community you:

1. must be currently working as a software developer, software engineer or software engineering manager in either:  
   1. a [central government department or arms-length body](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations)

### AGM, EGM and Elections

Elections will be held at the Annual General Meeting (AGM). 

The AGM will be held no later than 13 Months after the previous AGM. 

Officers will serve for a 1 year term (or until the next AGM), for a maximum of 3 years. 

Notice of the AGM will be issued to members by the secretary no less than 3 weeks in advance. Notice will include the agenda, location (usually an online meeting), date and time. 

An AGM requires the same quorum as the Management committee. 

The management committee can call an Extraordinary General Meeting at any time. The notice period and conditions of the AGM apply. 

### Accountability

The community is primarily accountable to its members through its ongoing active engagement and events, and through the AGM. 

All community members are required to uphold the Civil Service Code.

## Special Interest Groups

Special Interest Groups (SIG) can be created or disbanded by decision of the management committee. 

Each special interest group must nominate a SIG lead who attends the Management committee as an observer. 

The Management team Secretary will maintain an email list for the management committee of each SIG. 

The SIG lead should promptly notify the secretary of any changes to membership of each group. 

Each SIG should also:

* ensure information about forthcoming events is published on the website and other comms channels, working with the Communications officer  
* maintain notes about each meeting in the github community space [https://github.com/uk-x-gov-software-community/community-space](https://github.com/uk-x-gov-software-community/community-space)

A SIG which has not met for 6 months or more will be considered defunct and will be closed down.
